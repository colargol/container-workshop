Windows containers now fully supported with docker - you can now utilize the same deployment model and tooling but are able to run 
familar and known capabilities in the container. These exercises will give you some hands-on on Windows container and see how to built various windows base images for your deployments.

Make sure you've installed docker on your machine and enabled the Windows Container feature.
**You can do this exercise on either a virtualized Hyper-V container or on your Windows 10 -box.**
